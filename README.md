### Subject : &nbsp;

The project idea is to build a Todo List. Thanks to it, you’ll be able to handle all the tasks you need to do
easily! We will mainly focus on the “backend” side of the project, but feel free to show us what you can by
building a “frontend” to your project as a bonus.

Within this project, you’ll have to develop:

1. your MySQL database.
2. A web server using Node.js

Read the subject for more details and examples.

Good luck.
